## Running the project code
Download the "Compact_DL_projekt.ipynb" file and run it. We've attempted to clean up the code and provide only the neccesary parts 
which were required to produce our results from the report. 

If one would like to inspect all the work put into the project, download the file called 'DL_projekt.ipynb'. You can also run the code from this one.
(Note where to run the code from.)
