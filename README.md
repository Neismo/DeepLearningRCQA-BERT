# DeepLearningRCQA-BERT
Deep Learning 2021, DTU, Reading Comprehension with BERT.

## Running the project code
Download the "Compact_DL_projekt.ipynb" file and run it. We've attempted to clean up the code and provide only the neccesary parts 
which were required to produce our results from the report. 

As we were not able to test the compact notebook due to time constraints, if the code should fail to run download 'DL_projekt.ipynb' 
and run it from the specified point (marked in the notebook itself).
